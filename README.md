# DSA Visualizer

## Overview

The DSA Visualizer is a web application designed to help users understand and visualize various data structures and algorithms through interactive animations. This tool provides a platform for learning and experimenting with algorithms in real-time, making complex concepts more accessible and understandable.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Visualize how different algorithms work step-by-step.
- **Supports Multiple Data Structures**: Includes arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more.
- **Algorithm Animations**: Animate sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort) and search algorithms (e.g., Binary Search).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive and responsive UI for easy navigation and usage.
- **Code Snippets**: View the corresponding code for each algorithm and data structure in multiple programming languages.
- **Custom Input**: Allow users to input their own data to visualize specific scenarios.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with frameworks such as React, Vue, or Angular)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express (if applicable for user data or settings)
- **Data Visualization**: D3.js or similar libraries for rendering visualizations
- **Deployment**: Hosted on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or Heroku

## Installation
